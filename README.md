### What's here?

This is a Ruby on Rails version of my personal website.  Currently it's build with mostly-static pages (as Hartl calls it).  Perhaps it will evolve into a dynamic site in the future.

### Features

The site is completely Javascript free.  It uses only HTML5 and CSS3 transforms to produce some of the more interactive effects.

### Progress

Currently the site only renders correctly in a browser that uses webkit.  It gets close in Firefox.  It looks absolutely terrible in IE9 (and I'm not sure why).

### Legal

If you like any of the interesting transforms I've done and want to use them from my style sheet, just send a link back my way.
