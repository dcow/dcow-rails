{"tagline":"Rails version of my personal website.","body":"## dcow-site\r\n\r\n12 Sept 2012\r\n\r\n### What's here?\r\n\r\nThis is a Ruby on Rails version of my personal website.  Currently it's build with mostly-static pages (as [Hartl calls it](http://railstutorial.org/book).  Perhaps it will evolve into a dynamic site in the future.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nThe site is completely Javascript free.  It uses only [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/html/) and [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) transforms to produce some of the more interactive effects.\r\n\r\n### Progress\r\n\r\nCurrently the site only renders correctly in a browser that uses webkit -- such as Chrome or Safari.  It gets close in Firefox.  It looks absolutely terrible in IE9 (and I'm not sure why).\r\n\r\n### Legal\r\n\r\nIf you like any of the interesting transforms I've done and want to use them from my style sheet, just send a link back my way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":"","name":"Dcow-rails"}
